# Nature Walk

Nature Walk is a web application being developed for children to encourage them to explore the outdoors. As a society, we're spending more and more time in front of a screen. We're not getting enough exercise and connecting with the world around us. We need to balance our time and not forget that unplugging is just as important, if not more important, than surfing the web, interacting with digital apps / games, and watching TV / video.

As I researched apps for nature exploration and children, I found them to be too juvenile, too advanced, or only available on certain devices. There weren't many apps for children who would benefit from more than pictures and sounds but aren't ready for all text. I wanted something with realistic pictures, introductory information to pique interest, and a way to search for more information if desired.

Nature Walk allows children to learn about life forms they might find in the woods. My hope is that Nature Walk will:
* Inspire children to ask their parents and family members to go on adventures and explore the outdoors.
* Promote care and respect for the environment.
* Reignite curiosity in the adults who join the adventure and remind them how much fun it is to connect with nature.



Site architecture, UI/UX design, data flow, and project management are included in the planning folder.
